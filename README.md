Simple Pokedex application. It uses the awesome [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for all the data.

How could this app be better?:

- Remove flashing effect when loading SVGs. This could be done by waiting resources to load or loading based on viewport.
- Use more data from the API
- Add colors for the Pokemon types: Electric: Yellow, Water: Blue and so on.
